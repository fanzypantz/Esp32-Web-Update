# Esp32 Web Update

Library for updating the firmware of an Esp32 device over the web.

## â˜• Using this library

To use this library, you need to download, install the library and include the following file in your project:

```
#include <web_update.h>
```

After that, you declare the web_update object with the folowing customizations:

HOST - The URL to the firmware file. - Mandatory

Debbuger - If you want to know what's happening on the update via Serial, set this to 1. - Opcional (Default: 0)

Buffer Size - The size of the buffer to store the firmware. - Opcional (Default: 64)

Time Out - Timeout for the update process. - Opcional (Default: 60)

```
web_update webUpdate(String HOST, int Debbuger, int BUFFER_SIZE, int TIME_OUT);
```

When you want to start the update process, you call the following method:

```
webUpdate.update();
```

If any error occurs, the method will return the error code:

1 - Wifi not connected.

2 - File or host not found.

3 - Update Timeout.

## Errors that i have seen:

If you create the firmware file (.bin) on arduino and make the update firmware (.bin) on platformio or vice versa, the update process will complete but when the esp32 try to load the firmware will show that the firmware its corrupted! The firmware and the update firmware MUST BE ON THE SAME PLATFORM!.

Future updates will suport ethernet and other network types.
